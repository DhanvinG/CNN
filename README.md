# Convolutional Neural Network for MNIST Digit Classification

## Overview

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The CNN uses convolution and pooling layers to achieve high accuracy in digit recognition. The project is built using PyTorch and utilizes the Adam optimizer for training.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is a large collection of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each of size 28x28 pixels.

## Project Structure

- `CNN2.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the code for loading the dataset, building the CNN, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- `torch`
- `torchvision`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
